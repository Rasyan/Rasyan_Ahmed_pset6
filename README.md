# deadline:

on the deadline day the api was not working, and as such i could not make a tour of the app in this readme, after contacting the api they told me it would be fixed by the weekend, this was indeed true.
The text below is from the deadline day, it explains what was going on.

Currently as of 27/28 october 2016 the api i am using is heavily bugged.
It was fine up to a few days ago.
as you can see from the image below, their api will not show any images, their own site is having the same problem.
I will try to make a proper readme when the api is fully working again. or i will hardcode an example.
